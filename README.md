# tango_with_django_project
Me working my way thru Tango with Django 1.9+

I learned a lot working thru this book. I was dissapointed that the code was riddled with errors. If the authors had gone thru the book
step by step and typed in the provided code they would see that, time and time again, it doesn't work. I managed to work my way thru it
and figured out how to get it working but it was frustrating because I didn't know initially if it was something I typed wrong or
something the authors had published wrong.

Also very hard to figure out the exercises, because if you get stuck there really isn't any solution to look at other than the github
upload from the authors. Chapter 6 was the hardest for me, I could not figure out how to code it. Finally between looking at the authors
github and my own code I managed to piece something together that worked. No idea if it was correct.
